# Visualize earthquake data from [USGS GeoJSON Feed](http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php) using Leaflet

A front-end application that uses HTML, CSS, JavaSctipt and Leaflet.js to present an interactive visualization of earthquakes over a selected period of time (Past hour/day/7 days/30 days) and their magnitudes.

* Marker size and color reflect magnitude of earthquake. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes appear larger and darker in color.
* Marker popups provide additional information about the earthquake.
* Legend provides context for magnitude.
* A number of base maps is available to choose from and overlays can be turned on and off independently.
* A second layer is added to the map to illustrate the relationship between tectonic plates and seismic activity.
